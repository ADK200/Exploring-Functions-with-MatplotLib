The purpose of the researching is to study the function
$$\LARGE f(x) = \frac{x^{\beta} + \alpha^{\beta}}{x^{\beta} }$$
with different values $\alpha$ Ð¸ $\beta$.

For each task needs:

- Build a graph (the size of the graph should be sufficient to visually see the features of the studied functions), the graph of each function should be of the same color for one value of $ \ alpha $ and $ \ beta $.</font>
